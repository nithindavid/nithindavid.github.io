          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hi Iâ€™m Nithin David Thomas, a 21 year old web designer/developer from kerala, India. 
          What he did at the World Cup, people don't talk about it. They don't talk about it, but they should talk about it. He plays the game the right way: he defends, he attacks, he controls the ball when he has to control it, he reverses when he has to reverse it. When he has to finish, he'll finish.
          He doesn't do stepovers, but when he has to perform, he performs. He does what the game asks him to do.</p>
